/**
 * There are currently 3 collision shape types:
 * <point/>
 * <ul> <li><b>Circles</b>: Fastest and simplest collision shape.</li> <li><b>Line segments</b>: Meant mainly as a
 * static shape. They can be attached to moving dynamicBodies, but they don’alpha currently generate collisions with other line
 * segments. Can be beveled in order to give them a thickness.</li> <li><b>Convex polygons</b>: Slowest, but most
 * flexible collision shape.</li> </ul>
 * <point/>
 * You can add as many shapes to a body as you wish. That is why the two types are separate. This should give you the
 * flexibility to make any shape you want as well providing different areas of the same object with different friction,
 * elasticity or callback values.
